# **LeetCode Learning Group**

Welcome to the **LeetCode Learning Group**, where developers collaborate to enhance their problem-solving skills by tackling algorithm and data structure challenges. Together, we aim to master key concepts, prepare for technical interviews, and foster a supportive learning environment.

---

## **Group Objective**

Our mission is to:
- Build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
- Develop problem-solving skills through consistent practice.
- Encourage peer-to-peer learning and constructive feedback.
- Prepare members for technical interviews and coding assessments.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Daily Practice**  
   - **1â€“2 LeetCode questions** will be assigned daily (focused on Easy and Medium levels for now).  
   - Members solve these problems independently and share their solutions in the group.  
   - Solutions can be correct or incorrect â€” every attempt contributes to learning.

2. **Weekly Topics**  
   - Each week, we cover a specific data structure or algorithm topic (or two weeks for robust topics).  
   - The topic includes 5â€“10 selected problems to solve and discuss over the week.

3. **Solution Sharing**  
   - Every member must post their solution in the group daily, irrespective of correctness.  
   - Correct solutions require a **voice explanation** in the group to earn points.  
     - **Explanation Content**: Problem understanding, logic, steps, and edge cases.

4. **Weekly Call**  
   - A video or voice call is held every week to discuss:  
     - The weekâ€™s topic.  
     - Solutions to all assigned problems.  
     - Strategies, best practices, and challenges faced.  

5. **Competitions and Rankings**  
   - Weekly rankings will be updated based on participation, problem-solving, and explanations.  
   - Head-to-head matches or coding competitions may be held to simulate real-world challenges.

## **Rules and Guidelines**

### **General Rules**
1. Solve and submit solutions for assigned problems daily.  
2. Provide a voice explanation for correct solutions to earn points.  
3. Avoid plagiarism â€” share only your original work or clearly cite any adapted resources.  
4. Be respectful and supportive in all interactions.

### **AI Usage**
- The use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) for generating solutions is prohibited.  
- Members are encouraged to rely on their own understanding and logic.

### **Discussions and Feedback**
- Constructive discussions are encouraged.  
- Avoid negativity, sarcasm, or dismissive comments.  
- Share learning resources relevant to the groupâ€™s topic.

## **Weekly Schedule**

### **Mondayâ€“Friday**
- Solve **1â€“2 daily problems** based on the weekâ€™s topic.  
- Post solutions and explanations in the group.

### **Saturday**
- Review and practice additional problems from the weekly topic.  
- Revisit challenging questions and clarify doubts in the group.

### **Sunday**
- Participate in the **weekly call** to review:  
  - The weekâ€™s topic and key learnings.  
  - Solutions for assigned problems.  
  - Feedback and rankings.
